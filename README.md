## Introduction: 

This python script will read in a CSV file which includes various cryptocurrencies and price change during different periods. Using this data, the script will read and prepare the raw data. It will find the best `k` value using an Elbow Curve, it will cluster cryptocurrencies with the K-Means method, and optimize the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

Next, it will find the best `k` using the PCA data, cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA Data. 

Lastly, the script will visualize and compare the results. 

## Usage:
